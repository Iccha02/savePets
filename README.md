SAVE Animals Repository

##Goals

Three Montgomery Upper Middle School students are working on an app for SAVE (an animal shelter) to provide the following capabilities to potential adopters, volunteers and for people who want to make donations.    They are currently developing the capability to provide easy access to information on cats and dogs available to a potential adopter. This capability will make it easy to select a pet to adopt based on categories such as breed and size.  The second phase is to add a page to speed up the process of donating food or supplies needed for the shelter.  The third phase is to add a page where people can sign up to volunteer their time based on shelter's needs.
