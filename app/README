SAVE Animals Repository

##Goals

Three Montgomery Upper Middle School students are working on an app for SAVE (an animal shelter) to provide the following capabilities -

* Allow potential adopters to view pet inventory and contact SAVE if interested
* Allow people to see what donations SAVE needs
* Allow potential volunteers to sign-up


##Backlog

* Currently, pet inventory is packaged with the app as a local file - we need to connect the app to a remote data base/file
* Build out volunteer page and email capability
* Build out donate page

##Development Platform

* AppceleratorStudio 4.0 download at https://web.appcelerator.com/product/studio
* Languages used: JavaScript, XML
